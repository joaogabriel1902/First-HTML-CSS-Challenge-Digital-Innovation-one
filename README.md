# FIRST-HTML-CSS-Website-Digital-Innovation-One :grinning:
This **website** was one of my first **HTML/CSS** projects, I used all the concepts I learned in the digital innovation one's course.
Which includes:

- Tables.
- Paragraphs.
- DIV'S.
- ID's and Classe's
- Anchor tags.
- Meta.
- Links.
- Images.
- Buttons.

If you want to test the website as well just simply dowload the files and open the index called "paginaprincipal.index".

Feel free to contact me if you find something wrong. :exclamation:
